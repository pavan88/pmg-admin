							<p>Welcome to PMG. PMG aims at giving the power back to the people. But, with great power, comes greater responsibility. Before you can proceed to register, we expect you to be very well versed with PMG’s Rules Of Engagement (RoE). Please keep in mind, you will face a short quiz based on the RoE, and you need to pass the quiz in order to qualify to register at PMG.</p>
							<p>If you really are serious about your adsense or similar business, we hope you won’t mind going through these thoroughly and are already aware of some or all of the rules mentioned here. On the other hand, if you are averse to reading and remembering these, we suggest you close the website right now.</p>
